Hi, I'm Vincent! I'm a computer science generalist interested in a wide range of things.

I recently graduated from the **M.Sc. Informatics** program at the **Technical University of Munich (TUM)**. In the last years, I had the chance to be involved in a number of research projects in the machine learning and medical imaging fields (in the [TUM DI-LAB](https://www.mdsi.tum.de/en/di-lab/tum-di-lab/) at the [CAMP chair](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/camp/start/), at the [Theoretical Foundations of AI chair](https://www.cs.cit.tum.de/tfai/home/), at [ImFusion](https://www.imfusion.com/), and at the [Lab for AI in Medicine](https://aim-lab.io/)), and several projects led to published papers.

I also have a passion for mathematics, and completed a **B.Sc. in Mathematics** alongside my **B.Sc. in Computer Science** at the **University of Passau**.
I like to work somewhere close to the border between computer science and mathematics, such as with my Master's thesis, which explored a topological loss functions rooted in persistent homology, and my Bachelor's thesis, which was about the properties of a particular stochastic order and whether or not it can be used for game theory.

I've worked with a variety of programming languages and technologies, and I'm always keen to learn new ones. **Python** is my go-to language for machine learning and most day-to-day coding needs. More recently I've began to use more **C++**, and of course I love **Rust** and try to find a reason to use it whenever I can. I'm also using _JavaScript_ for interactive visualizations and creative coding, and have used _C#_ for a lot of different projects before I started my studies. I've also used _Haskell_, _Julia_ and several other languages in projects.
