title: 'I published my post on the relAI blog: "Using topological features to prevent topological errors"'
---

My blogpost on persistent homology for machine learning, based on the line of research I had the chance to contribute to in my master's thesis, was posted on the relAI blog: 

[Read the blogpost at the relAI blog](https://zuseschoolrelai.de/blog/topologically-correct-predictions-why-care-about-them-and-what-does-topological-correctness-even-mean/)

The post is an easy-to-parse introduction to the basic concepts of topological data analysis (persistent homology), namely what it intuitively means to identify topological features in images and measure their persistence over a range of brightness values. The relAI (short for the *Konrad Zuse School of Excellence in Reliable AI*) blog publishes post by the master and PhD students supported by the relAI program about their reliable AI research.
